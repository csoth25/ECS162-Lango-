# ECS162-Flashcard App, Part 2 

Server to run is 'langoServer.js'.
File to start off the application is 'Welcome.html'.

Note: We designed our card flip feature to flip the flashcard when the user presses on it and have it flip back when user stops pressing on it. This design is for a quick review if they're unsure of the answer and was approved by Professor Amenta.
